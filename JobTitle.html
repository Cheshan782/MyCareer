        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>A cardiologist is a certified medical doctor that specializes on anything involving the heart and blood vessels. They diagnose and treat conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and hypertension. Cardiologists also manage heart attacks and may perform procedures like angioplasty. Their expertise extends to preventative measures to maintain cardiovascular health. Advancements in technology have significantly enhanced the field of cardiology. Innovations such as wearable heart monitors, advanced imaging techniques, and minimally invasive procedures have improved diagnosis and treatment. These technologies allow cardiologists to provide more accurate, timely, and effective care for their patients.</p>

        <h2>Hours</h2>
        <p>They typically work in hospitals, and most of the time they have their own private physicians. When working in a hospital you usually work 40 hours a week, and sometimes can be on call for nights.Â During a hospital shift, they monitor patients' vital signs, administer medications, and assist with medical procedures. They also communicate with other healthcare professionals to ensure comprehensive patient care and update medical records. Additionally, they provide emotional support to patients and their families.</p>

      <div style="background-color: indianred;" class="flip-card-back">
        <p style="text-align: center; padding: 100px 10px 10px 0;">On call means not being at work but available if needed. For example, a nurse who is on call may be available to provide assistance in case of an emergency. The nurse does not have to stay in the hospital. This is very tiring because you can be called at any time. For some people, this is unsettling because they feel under pressure the whole time. I, however, think this on-call strategy benefits me.</p>

  <h2>Will This Affect My Mental Health</h2>
  <p style="color: white; text-align: center; padding: 20px;">I don't think this will affect my mental health for many reasons. 42% of cardiologists are experiencing burnout according to vitalSolutions. This is much higher than other occupations, however from my surveys I think as an introvert my main subject area is science, and I have found different strategies to avoid burnout like playing sports or reading books. I think because of these reasons this job won't affect my mental health</p>
