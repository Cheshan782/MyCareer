        <h2>Dependability</h2>
        <p>For this job, they asked for someone dependable, and I am confident that's me. From a young age, many people depend on me. I believe this skill grew in me because of sports and how everyone relies on everyone to win. That mindset has led me to win in my hockey career and I believe it will help me in this job. In my previous roles, my dependability ensured projects were completed on time and to high standard. My supervisors often entrusted me with critical tasks, knowing I would deliver consistent results. This reliability helped foster a productive and trust-filled work environment.</p>

        <h2>Accurate</h2>
        <p>I am confident in my accuracy as well. I have always been accurate in everything I do with my logical mindset. I have more interests in maths and sciences, than say french or english. My logical mindset helps me solve complex problems and understand intricate concepts in these subjects. It enables me to approach equations and scientific theories systematically, ensuring precision in my work. This analytical thinking enhances my ability to excel in maths and sciences.</p>
